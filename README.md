My general plan for this project is to slowly populate the flash cards with vocab as I study new words.
In the beginning this will simply be a page of flash cards in each category, verbs, adverbs, etc. that flip over to reveal the translation on hover.
I would like to add additional functionality such as showing conjugation for each particular verb, and creating some way to record which words I know better than others.

Maybe something involving putting the words into a database? hmmm
